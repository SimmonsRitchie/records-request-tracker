### RTK Tracker

This app is designed to help journalists in Pennsylvania track government record requests filed under the state's 'Right to Know Law'.

Because it typically takes agencies in Pennsylvania at least 35 days to provide records, it can be difficult for reporters to keep tabs on the requests they've filed. If an agency ultimately denies a request, forcing a reporter to file an appeal with Pennsylvania's Office of Open Records, this process can take months. Requests that are ultimately challenged in Commonwealth Court may be left in limbo for years.

This app not only provides a searchable interface for organizing Pennsylvania record requests it provides estimated dates when agencies are legally obligated to respond to them. There have been a number of cases where government agencies in Pennsylvania (particularly small agencies, like school districts) have breached these deadlines. This app is designed to make it easier to hold these agencies accountable.
