### RTK Tracker

This is a React JS app designed to help journalists in Pennsylvania track government record requests filed under the state's 'Right to Know Law'.

### Motivation

It typically takes agencies in Pennsylvania at least 35 days to provide records in response to public record requests. That means it can be difficult for reporters to keep tabs on the requests they've filed. 

If an agency ultimately denies a request, forcing a reporter to file an appeal with Pennsylvania's Office of Open Records, this process can take months. Requests that are ultimately challenged in Commonwealth Court may be left in limbo for years.

This app provides a searchable interface for organizing Pennsylvania record requests and it calculates estimated dates when agencies are legally obligated to respond to them. There have been a number of cases where government agencies in Pennsylvania (particularly small agencies, like school districts) have breached these deadlines. This app is designed to make it easier to hold these agencies accountable.
